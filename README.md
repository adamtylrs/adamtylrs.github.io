    <h1>Value of Cockroaches</h1>

    <h4>Introduction: Few insects receive the same level of disdain as cockroaches, with hatred for roaches sometimes topping even the hate reserved mosquitos. Despite the cockroach's impressive evolutionary "run" (nearly 200 million years and counting) and status as a keystone animal in many ecosystems, the majority of people are simply not well-versed in the world of roaches. This website is my futile attempt to portray roaches in a "fair" light so that you, the reader, can at least hate cockroaches fairly. </h4>
    <h4>Evolution: In order to understand roaches, we must understand their evolution. While <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180208180359.htm" target="_blank">this link</a> goes into far more detail about the origins of the roach, it is only necesary to understand three things about the history of one of humanity's most hated pests.</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Cockroaches are old. Very old. </li>
      <li>Because they are very old, they have made their way into virtually every continent and ecosystem.</li>
      <li>Cockroaches actually encompass a very wide range of species, ranging from the despised American cockroach to the far less hated Madagascar hissing cockroach.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>The final portion is extremely important. All too often we lump entire categories of animals into the "pest" box when only a select few truly belong there. While this thought process may be "inconsequential" when applied to insects, allowing oneself to hate an entire group of animals due to the behavior of a select few is a dangerous way of thinking that has led to the near complete destruction of a variety of keystone species, such as gray wolves and american bison. Hating an animal should be a decision that is based on facts and logic - not one's knee-jerk reaction to it.
      <h4><strong>Why do we hate insects?</strong> Despite the majority of insects - cockroaches included - posing virtually no threat to us, we still seem to fear them, begging the question of why we do when logically, it appears to be irrational.</h4> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6zX9f52tPK8?si=BScrF3iVK1w0kIGU"></iframe>
