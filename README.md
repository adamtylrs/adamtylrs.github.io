    <h4>Introduction: Few insects receive the same level of disdain as cockroaches, with hatred for roaches sometimes topping even the hate reserved mosquitos. Despite the cockroach's impressive evolutionary "run" (nearly 320 million years and counting) and status as a keystone animal in many ecosystems, the majority of people are simply not well-versed in the world of roaches. This website is my futile attempt to portray roaches in a "fair" light so that you, the reader, can at least hate cockroaches fairly. </h4>
    <h4>Evolution: In order to understand roaches, we must understand their evolution. </h4>
